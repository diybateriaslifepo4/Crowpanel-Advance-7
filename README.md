# CrowPanel Advance 7 ESPHome compatibility

Here is my little contribution to make this display work on ESPHOME

The code is based on a small Hello World with some buttons that act on a counter, and some color patterns, to test the image and the touch.

Anyone is free to use the code and modify it as they wish
